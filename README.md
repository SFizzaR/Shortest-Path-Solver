# 🔍Shortest-Path Solver: Bellman-Ford vs. Dijkstra

This project implements a shortest-path solver that compares the **Bellman-Ford** and **Dijkstra’s** algorithms, analyzing their execution times under different graph scenarios.

## ✨Features✨
- **📌 Graph Input**: Users can define graphs through a GUI.  
- **🔄 Algorithm Selection**: Choose between Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra’s algorithms.  
- **⏳ Execution Time Analysis**: Compare their performances on different graph types.  
- **🖥️ Visualization**: Display the computed shortest paths.
 
## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter  
- **Graph Processing**: NetworkX (optional for visualization)  

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd shortest-path-solver
   
2. Run the program (first the algorithms, then compare.py):
   ```sh
   python <filename>.py

## 🎯 Usage
- Open the GUI and enter the graph details.
- Select the algorithm to run (Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra).
- View the computed shortest path and execution time analysis.

## 📊 Performance Analysis
| Algorithm |	Time Complexity |	Best for |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| Bellman-Ford |	O(VE) |	Graphs with negative weights |
| Dijkstra |	O(V log V) | (priority queue)	Graphs with non-negative weights |

The program compares execution times for different graph sizes and structures to provide insights into their efficiency.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add support for more graph algorithms (e.g., A*).
- Improve visualization with Matplotlib/NetworkX.
- Allow importing graphs from files.
